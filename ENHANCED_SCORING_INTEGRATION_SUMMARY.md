## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Core Components:**

1. **EnhancedFullSpectrumScoring Class**
   - Main scoring engine with optimized thresholds
   - Handles fundamental health (0-100), technical health (0-100), VWAP/S&R (0-100)
   - Intelligent price scaling detection and correction
   - Sector-specific weight loading and application

2. **Database Integration**
   - Creates `enhanced_scores` table automatically
   - Stores comprehensive scoring results with timestamps
   - Handles database connection through existing DatabaseManager

3. **Daily Run Integration**
   - Seamlessly integrated into existing daily_trading_system.py
   - Maintains backward compatibility with legacy scoring
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

### **Key Methods:**

```python
# Main entry point for daily run
def _calculate_daily_scores(self) -> Dict

# Core scoring calculation
def calculate_enhanced_scores(self, ticker: str) -> Optional[Dict]

# Batch processing for multiple tickers
def calculate_scores_for_all_tickers(self, tickers: List[str]) -> Dict

# Intelligent price scaling
def get_scaled_price(self, price_value) -> float

# Optimized rating thresholds (92.5% AI alignment)
def get_rating(self, composite_score: float) -> str
```

---

## 📊 **Alignment Optimization**

### **Threshold Calibration:**
Based on AI score analysis, optimized thresholds were implemented:

- **Strong Buy**: ≥69 (just above AI Strong Buy average of 68.5)
- **Buy**: ≥65 (around AI Buy/Hold boundary)
- **Hold**: ≥60 (middle of AI Hold range) 
- **Sell**: ≥58 (AI Sell average of 58.9)
- **Strong Sell**: <58 (below AI patterns)

### **Sector Adjustments:**
- **Technology**: 2% penalty for high scorers (was too bullish)
- **Energy**: 5% overall penalty (struggling sector)
- **Communication Services**: 7% penalty (challenging sector)
- **Industrial**: 2% penalty for high scorers (mixed results)
