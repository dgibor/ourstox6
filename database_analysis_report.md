### ❌ What's NOT Currently Calculated

**Critical Missing Calculations:**

1. **Financial Ratios Table - Most Columns Empty:**
   - Only basic PE, PB, PS ratios are calculated in some files
   - Missing: ROE, ROA, ROIC, margins, efficiency ratios, growth metrics
   - Missing: Altman Z-score, Graham number, quality metrics

2. **Company Fundamentals Table - Incomplete Population:**
   - Many fundamental fields are not populated from API data
   - Missing: Cash flow data, detailed balance sheet items
   - Missing: Per-share metrics calculations

3. **Investor Scores Table - Not Implemented:**
   - Schema exists but no calculation logic found
   - Missing: Conservative, GARP, deep value scores
   - Missing: Component scores (valuation, quality, health, etc.)

4. **Industry Benchmarks Table - Not Populated:**
   - Schema exists but no calculation logic
   - Missing: Industry averages and percentiles

## 3. Database Schema Analysis

### Daily Charts Table
**Status:** ✅ **WELL IMPLEMENTED**
- All technical indicator columns defined
- Calculation logic exists and tested
- Data quality monitoring implemented

### Financial Ratios Table  
**Status:** ❌ **SCHEMA ONLY - NO CALCULATIONS**
- Comprehensive schema with 25+ ratio columns
- Only basic PE/PB/PS ratios calculated in some files
- Missing calculation logic for 80% of ratios

### Company Fundamentals Table
**Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**
- Schema defined with 20+ fundamental fields
- Basic data population from APIs exists
- Missing: Many fields not populated, ratio calculations incomplete

### Investor Scores Table
**Status:** ❌ **SCHEMA ONLY - NO IMPLEMENTATION**
- Schema exists with comprehensive scoring structure
- No calculation logic found in codebase
- Missing: All scoring algorithms

## 4. Root Cause Analysis

### Why Calculations Are Missing

1. **Incomplete Implementation:**
   - Schema was designed comprehensively but calculation logic not fully implemented
   - Focus was on technical indicators first, fundamentals second
   - Many ratio calculation functions exist but aren't integrated into main workflow

2. **API Data Mapping Issues:**
   - API services return data but not all fields are mapped to database columns
   - Missing data transformation logic between API response and database storage

3. **Calculation Dependencies:**
   - Some ratios require multiple data sources (price + fundamentals)
   - Missing integration between price data and fundamental calculations

4. **Workflow Gaps:**
   - Daily trading system focuses on technical indicators
   - Fundamental calculations are separate and not fully integrated
   - Missing scheduled calculation jobs for ratios and scores

## 5. Recommendations for Fixes

### Priority 1: Complete Fundamental Ratio Calculations

**File:** `daily_run/fundamental_ratio_calculator.py` (NEW)
```python
class FundamentalRatioCalculator:
    def calculate_all_ratios(self, ticker: str) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Calculate all financial ratios for a ticker"""
        
    def calculate_valuation_ratios(self, price: float, fundamentals: Dict) -> Dict:
        """PE, PB, PS, EV/EBITDA, PEG ratios"""
        
    def calculate_profitability_ratios(self, fundamentals: Dict) -> Dict:
        """ROE, ROA, ROIC, margins"""
        
    def calculate_financial_health_ratios(self, fundamentals: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Debt ratios, current ratio, Altman Z-score"""
        
    def calculate_efficiency_ratios(self, fundamentals: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Asset turnover, inventory turnover"""
        
    def calculate_growth_metrics(self, historical_fundamentals: List) -> Dict:
        """YoY growth calculations"""
```

### Priority 2: Implement Investor Scoring System

**File:** `daily_run/investor_score_calculator.py` (NEW)
```python
class InvestorScoreCalculator:
    def calculate_conservative_score(self, ratios: Dict) -> int:
        """Conservative investor score (0-100)"""
        
    def calculate_garp_score(self, ratios: Dict) -> int:
        """GARP investor score (0-100)"""
        
    def calculate_deep_value_score(self, ratios: Dict) -> int:
        """Deep value investor score (0-100)"""
        
    def calculate_component_scores(self, ratios: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Valuation, quality, health, profitability, growth, management scores"""
```

### Priority 3: Complete Data Population Workflow

**File:** `daily_run/fundamental_data_processor.py` (ENHANCE)
```python
class FundamentalDataProcessor:
    def populate_all_fundamental_fields(self, ticker: str, api_data: Dict):
        """Populate all company_fundamentals fields from API data"""
        
    def calculate_and_store_ratios(self, ticker: str):
        """Calculate all ratios and store in financial_ratios table"""
        
    def calculate_and_store_scores(self, ticker: str):
        """Calculate all investor scores and store in investor_scores table"""
```

### Priority 4: Industry Benchmark Calculations

**File:** `daily_run/industry_benchmark_calculator.py` (NEW)
```python
class IndustryBenchmarkCalculator:
    def calculate_industry_averages(self, sector: str):
        """Calculate industry averages and percentiles"""
        
    def update_benchmarks_daily(self):
        """Daily update of industry benchmarks"""
```

### Priority 5: Integration into Daily Workflow

**File:** `daily_run/daily_trading_system.py` (ENHANCE)
```python
def _calculate_fundamentals_and_technicals(self):
    # Add to existing method:
    fundamental_processor = FundamentalDataProcessor()
    ratio_calculator = FundamentalRatioCalculator()
    score_calculator = InvestorScoreCalculator()
    
    for ticker in tickers:
        # 1. Populate fundamental data
        fundamental_processor.populate_all_fundamental_fields(ticker, api_data)
        
        # 2. Calculate all ratios
        ratio_calculator.calculate_and_store_ratios(ticker)
        
        # 3. Calculate all scores
        score_calculator.calculate_and_store_scores(ticker)
```
