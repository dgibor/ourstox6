# Daily Trading System Update Summary

## Overview
Updated `daily_run/daily_trading_system.py` to follow the exact priority schema specified by the user, ensuring proper data collection order based on API rate limits and operational priorities.

## New Priority-Based Schema

### PRIORITY 1 (Most Important)
**Condition**: If it was a trading day
**Actions**:
- Get price data for all stocks and update `daily_charts` table
- Calculate all technical indicators based on updated prices
- Skip to Priority 2 if market was closed

### PRIORITY 2 
**Target**: Companies with earnings announcements that day
**Actions**:
- Update fundamental information for earnings announcement companies
- Calculate fundamental ratios based on updated stock prices
- Uses earnings calendar data to identify target companies

### PRIORITY 3
**Target**: Ensure historical data completeness
**Actions**:
- Update historical prices until at least 100 days of data for every company
- Uses remaining API calls after Priorities 1 and 2
- Prioritizes companies with the least historical data

### PRIORITY 4
**Target**: Data completeness
**Actions**:
- Fill missing fundamental data for companies
- Uses any remaining API calls after Priorities 1, 2, and 3
- Targets companies with incomplete fundamental data

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Restructured Main Method
- `run_daily_trading_process()` now follows the exact 4-priority sequence
- Clear priority logging with emojis for easy monitoring
- Proper API call tracking and limits enforcement

### 2. New Priority-Specific Methods
- `_calculate_technical_indicators_priority1()` - Technical indicators for trading days
- `_update_earnings_announcement_fundamentals()` - Earnings-based fundamental updates
- `_ensure_minimum_historical_data()` - 100+ days historical data requirement
- `_fill_missing_fundamental_data()` - Fill gaps in fundamental data

### 3. Enhanced Helper Methods
- `_get_earnings_announcement_tickers()` - Identifies companies with earnings today
- `_get_tickers_needing_100_days_history()` - Finds companies below 100-day threshold
- `_get_tickers_missing_fundamental_data()` - Identifies incomplete fundamental data
- `_get_historical_data_to_minimum()` - Ensures minimum historical data requirements
- `_update_single_ticker_fundamentals()` - Updates individual company fundamentals
- `_calculate_fundamental_ratios()` - Calculates PE, PB, PS, debt-to-equity ratios

### 4. Improved API Rate Limit Management
- Tracks API calls across all priorities
- Respects daily limits (1000 calls conservative)
- Skips lower priorities when limits reached
- Clear logging of API usage per priority

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
- Each priority handles errors independently
- Failed operations don't break subsequent priorities
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Safe fallbacks for missing data

## Database Integration

### Tables Used
- `daily_charts` - Price data and technical indicators
- `company_fundamentals` - Fundamental data and calculated ratios
- `earnings_calendar` - Earnings announcement schedule
- `stocks` - Master ticker list

### Data Flow
1. **Price Updates** → `daily_charts` → Technical indicators calculation
2. **Earnings Detection** → Fundamental data fetch → Ratio calculation
3. **Historical Backfill** → `daily_charts` (historical data)
4. **Missing Data Fill** → `company_fundamentals` (complete gaps)

## API Service Integration
- Uses `enhanced_multi_service_manager` for robust data fetching
- Fallback services for reliability
- Batch processing for efficiency (100 stocks per call)
- Service-specific optimizations (FMP for fundamentals, Yahoo for prices)

## Key Features

### Trading Day Intelligence
- Checks market schedule before processing
- Skips price updates on non-trading days
- Adjusts priorities based on market status

### Earnings Calendar Integration
- Real-time earnings announcement detection
- Prioritizes companies with fresh earnings data
- Calculates ratios with latest price and fundamental data

### Historical Data Completeness
- Ensures minimum 100 days of price history
- Prioritizes companies with least data
- Efficient backfilling with API limits

### Robust Error Recovery
- Continues processing on individual ticker failures
- Zero-value fallbacks for missing technical indicators
- Comprehensive error logging and monitoring

## Operational Benefits

### 1. Priority-Based Resource Allocation
- Most time-sensitive operations first
- Efficient API quota utilization
- Clear operational priorities

### 2. Data Quality Assurance
- Ensures minimum historical data requirements
- Fresh fundamental data for earnings companies
- Complete technical indicator coverage

### 3. Production Reliability
- Robust error handling at every level
- Continues operation despite individual failures
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging

### 4. Scalability
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Configurable API limits
- Modular priority system

## Usage Examples

### Standard Daily Run (Trading Day)
```bash
python daily_trading_system.py
```
- Processes all 4 priorities in sequence
- Updates prices and calculates indicators
- Processes earnings announcements
- Backfills historical data
- Fills missing fundamentals

### Force Run (Non-Trading Day)
```bash
python daily_trading_system.py --force
```
- Forces Priority 1 execution
- Useful for testing or catch-up processing

### Configuration Options
- `max_api_calls_per_day`: Adjustable API limits
- `earnings_window_days`: Earnings detection window
- `max_batch_size`: Batch processing size

## Monitoring and Logging

### Priority-Specific Logging
- Clear phase identification with emojis
- Success/failure counts per priority
- API usage tracking per phase
- Processing time measurements

### Error Tracking
- Individual ticker failure logging
- Priority-level error summaries
- Database operation monitoring
- Service availability tracking

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Dynamic Priority Adjustment** - Adjust priorities based on market conditions
2. **Enhanced Earnings Detection** - Multiple earnings data sources
3. **Predictive Backfilling** - Anticipate data needs
4. **Real-time Monitoring** - Live system status dashboard

### Extensibility
- Easy addition of new priorities
- Pluggable data sources
- Configurable processing rules
- Modular architecture for enhancements
