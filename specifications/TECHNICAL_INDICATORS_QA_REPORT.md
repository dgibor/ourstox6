# Technical Indicators QA Report

## Executive Summary

As a QA Expert, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the daily_run technical indicator calculation functions and identified critical issues causing many columns in the daily_charts table to remain empty. The analysis revealed that **48.8% of records are missing RSI data**, **40.4% are missing EMA data**, and **41.3% are missing MACD data**.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Technical Indicators Not Being Calculated for Recent Data**
- **Issue**: Recent 7 days show 0% RSI and MACD coverage, only 4.9% EMA20 coverage
- **Impact**: All recent trading data lacks technical analysis indicators
- **Root Cause**: Technical calculation process failing or not being called

### 2. **Insufficient Historical Data for Calculations**
- **Issue**: Many tickers have less than 26 days of price data (minimum for MACD)
- **Examples**: SHLX, PBCT, ANTM, ZNH, RXN, Q, WRK, PNM, PDCE, SNP (all have only 20 days)
- **Impact**: Cannot calculate reliable technical indicators

### 3. **Poor Error Handling in Technical Calculations**
- **Issue**: The `_calculate_single_ticker_technicals()` function has complex error handling that may be failing silently
- **Problem**: NaN checks and validation logic may be too strict, causing valid calculations to be rejected

### 4. **Data Quality Issues**
- **Issue**: Some tickers have price data but completely missing technical indicators
- **Examples**: SWP (162 records, 0% technical coverage), BRK.B (156 records, 0% technical coverage)
- **Impact**: Inconsistent data quality across the database

## Database Analysis Results

### Overall Statistics
- **Total Records**: 73,229
- **Unique Tickers**: 673
- **Price Data Coverage**: 99.8% (excellent)
- **Technical Indicator Coverage**: 46-60% (poor)

### Technical Indicator Coverage
| Indicator | Records | Percentage |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| RSI 14 | 37,529 | 51.2% |
| EMA 20 | 43,626 | 59.6% |
| EMA 50 | 43,626 | 59.6% |
| MACD Line | 42,949 | 58.7% |
| MACD Signal | 42,677 | 58.3% |
| MACD Histogram | 42,626 | 58.2% |

### Recent Data Analysis (Last 7 Days)
- **Daily Records**: 41 per day
- **RSI Coverage**: 0.0% (CRITICAL)
- **EMA20 Coverage**: 4.9% (POOR)
- **MACD Coverage**: 0.0% (CRITICAL)

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Technical Calculation Process Failure**
The `_calculate_technical_indicators_priority1()` function in `daily_trading_system.py` may not be executing properly or may be failing silently.

### 2. **Data Validation Issues**
The technical indicator calculation functions have overly strict validation that may be rejecting valid calculations:
```python
# Problematic validation in _calculate_single_ticker_technicals()
if rsi_result is not None and len(rsi_result) > 0 and not rsi_result.iloc[-1] != rsi_result.iloc[-1]:  # NaN check
```

### 3. **Insufficient Historical Data**
The system requires 100+ days for reliable calculations but many tickers have only 20-50 days of data.

### 4. **Database Update Issues**
The `update_technical_indicators()` function may not be properly updating all records for a ticker.

## Recommended Fixes

### 1. **Immediate Fixes (High Priority)**

#### A. Fix Technical Calculation Logic
- Simplify error handling in `_calculate_single_ticker_technicals()`
- Remove overly strict NaN validation
- Add better logging for debugging

#### B. Implement Backfill Process
- Create a script to recalculate technical indicators for all tickers with price data
- Focus on tickers with sufficient historical data (26+ days)

#### C. Improve Data Validation
- Use more robust validation that doesn't reject valid calculations
- Add specific error messages for different failure types

### 2. **Medium Priority Fixes**

#### A. Enhance Historical Data Collection
- Ensure all tickers have at least 100 days of historical data
- Implement automatic historical data fetching for insufficient data

#### B. Improve Daily Process
- Add better error handling in the daily trading system
- Ensure technical calculations run after price updates

#### C. Add Monitoring
- Create alerts for when technical indicators fail to calculate
- Monitor data quality metrics

### 3. **Long-term Improvements**

#### A. Data Quality Framework
- Implement automated data quality checks
- Create data quality scoring system

#### B. Performance Optimization
- Optimize technical indicator calculations
- Implement batch processing for large datasets

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Fix (1-2 days)
1. Run the `fix_technical_indicators.py` script to backfill missing data
2. Fix the technical calculation logic in `daily_trading_system.py`
3. Test with a subset of tickers

### Phase 2: Process Improvement (3-5 days)
1. Enhance the daily trading system error handling
2. Implement better logging and monitoring
3. Add data quality validation

### Phase 3: Long-term Stability (1-2 weeks)
1. Implement comprehensive data quality framework
2. Add automated testing for technical calculations
3. Create monitoring dashboards

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `technical_indicators_qa_report.py` - Comprehensive analysis script
- `fix_technical_indicators.py` - Backfill script for missing technical indicators
- `test_daily_charts_analysis.py` - Database analysis script

### Files Requiring Updates
- `daily_run/daily_trading_system.py` - Fix technical calculation logic
- `daily_run/database.py` - Improve update functions
- `daily_run/indicators/*.py` - Enhance error handling

## Testing Strategy

### 1. **Unit Testing**
- Test individual technical indicator calculations
- Verify error handling for edge cases
- Test data validation logic

### 2. **Integration Testing**

## Conclusion

The technical indicator calculation system has significant issues that need immediate attention. The primary problems are:

1. **Process failure** - Technical calculations not running properly
2. **Data insufficiency** - Many tickers lack sufficient historical data
3. **Poor error handling** - Valid calculations being rejected
4. **Inconsistent updates** - Database not being properly updated

The recommended fixes will restore technical indicator functionality and improve data quality across the system. The `fix_technical_indicators.py` script provides an immediate solution for backfilling missing data, while the long-term improvements will prevent these issues from recurring.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Run the fix script to restore technical indicators
2. **Short-term**: Update the daily trading system logic
3. **Medium-term**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and validation
4. **Long-term**: Build robust data quality framework

This analysis provides a clear roadmap for fixing the technical indicator issues and ensuring reliable data quality going forward.
