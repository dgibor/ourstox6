# VALUE INVESTING DASHBOARD - IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE (UPDATED)

## 1. DASHBOARD PHILOSOPHY

**Core Principle:**
This dashboard translates fundamental analysis into actionable insights, helping investors identify undervalued companies with strong business fundamentals. Unlike technical analysis which focuses on price patterns, we evaluate the intrinsic value and business quality.

**Educational Framework:**
- Progressive disclosure: Simple scores for beginners, detailed metrics for advanced users
- Context-sensitive explanations via CSV files
- Three investor profiles: Conservative Value, Growth-at-Reasonable-Price (GARP), Deep Value

## 2. LAYOUT STRUCTURE

**Grid System (Matching Technical Dashboard):**
- **Header**: Company info, price, fundamental score toggle (Conservative/GARP/Deep Value)
- **Primary Cards** (2 large): Valuation Matrix, Business Quality Score
- **Secondary Cards** (4 medium): Profitability Trends, Financial Health, Growth Momentum, Management Effectiveness
- **Advanced Section**: Collapsible area for detailed ratios and peer comparison

## 3. CARD SPECIFICATIONS

## 5. CALCULATION METHODOLOGIES

### Intrinsic Value Calculations
1. **Graham Number**: âˆš(15 Ã— Diluted EPS Ã— Book Value per Share)
   - Use diluted EPS for conservative calculation
   - If negative earnings or book value, display "N/A" with explanation
   - For intangible-heavy businesses, provide adjusted calculation in tooltip

2. **DCF Simplified**: Use analyst consensus for cash flow projections
3. **Asset-Based**: Book Value with adjustments for intangibles
4. **Earnings Power**: Normalized earnings Ã— appropriate multiple

### Business Quality Scoring
- **ROE Quality**: Adjust for leverage (ROE = ROA Ã— Equity Multiplier)
- **ROIC**: (NOPAT / Invested Capital) compared to WACC
- **Moat Proxy**: Gross margin stability + ROIC persistence
- **FCF Quality**: FCF/Net Income ratio (quality of earnings)

### Risk Adjustments
- High debt (D/E > 2): Reduce score by 10%
- Negative FCF: Reduce score by 15%
- Declining margins: Reduce score by 5%
- High cyclicality: Adjust multiples downward

## 6. DATA HIERARCHY AND REQUIREMENTS

### Primary Data Points:
- Current Price (real-time during market hours)
- Market Cap (real-time)
- Enterprise Value (daily update)
- TTM Revenue, Earnings, FCF (quarterly update)
- Total Assets, Equity, Debt (quarterly update)
- Shares Outstanding (daily update)

### Data Handling Rules:
1. **Historical Data**: 
   - Minimum 3 years required, use available data if <5 years
   - Show "Limited History" warning for <3 years
   - Use TTM for all ratio calculations for consistency

2. **Missing Data**:
   - D/E Ratio with no debt: Display "No Debt" (positive indicator)
   - Missing metrics: Show "-" with tooltip explanation
   - Exclude from score calculation, adjust weights proportionally

3. **Update Frequency**:
   - Price & Market Cap: Every 5 minutes during market hours
   - Fundamental metrics: Daily after market close
   - Peer comparisons: Weekly on Sundays
   - Industry averages: Monthly

## 7. INDUSTRY COMPARISON LOGIC

### Classification Hierarchy:
1. Primary: Industry level (e.g., "Software")
2. Fallback: Sector level (e.g., "Technology")
3. Dynamic peer selection based on:
   - Market cap (Â±50% range)
   - Revenue (Â±50% range)
   - Minimum 5 peers required, maximum 20

### Special Entity Handling:
- **Financials**: Use P/B, ROE, NIM instead of D/E, margins
- **REITs**: Focus on FFO, dividend yield, P/FFO
- **Utilities**: Emphasize dividend stability, regulated ROE
- **Biotechs**: De-emphasize profitability, focus on cash runway

## 8. WARNING SYSTEM (ENHANCED)

### Threshold Types:
- **Absolute**: Apply regardless of industry (e.g., Altman Z < 1.8)
- **Relative**: Industry-adjusted (e.g., D/E > industry 75th percentile)
- **Dynamic**: Based on company history (e.g., margin decline >20%)

### Warning Aggregation:
- 2 yellow warnings = 1 orange warning
- 1 red warning overrides all others
- Cyclical adjustment: Reduce severity by one level for identified cyclicals

### Red Flags (ðŸ”´):
- Altman Z < 1.8 (absolute)
- Interest Coverage < 1.5x (absolute)
- Negative FCF for 2+ years (absolute)
- Debt/Equity > 90th percentile of industry (relative)

### Yellow Flags (ðŸŸ¡):
- Declining margins 3 years straight (dynamic)
- ROE declining while debt increasing (dynamic)
- Insider selling > 20% holdings (absolute)
- Revenue decline 2+ quarters (absolute)
