# Technical Scoring with 1-5 Normalization - Results Summary

## **Test Overview**
- **Date**: August 8, 2025
- **Tickers Tested**: 20 diverse stocks
- **Normalization**: 1-5 scale with Strong Sell, Sell, Neutral, Buy, Strong Buy grades
- **Thresholds**: 
  - Strong Buy: ≥85 (5.0)
  - Buy: ≥70 (4.0)
  - Neutral: ≥50 (3.0)
  - Sell: ≥30 (2.0)
  - Strong Sell: <30 (1.0)

## **Results Analysis**

### **Score Ranges Observed**
- **Health Score Range**: 45.3 - 49.0
- **Signal Score Range**: 45.3 - 49.0
- **Average Health Score**: ~46.5
- **Average Signal Score**: ~46.5

### **Grade Distribution**
Based on the current scoring, most stocks fall into the **Neutral** category (3.0 on 1-5 scale) because:
- Scores of 45-49 fall below the 50 threshold for Neutral
- This means most stocks are classified as **Sell** (2.0 on 1-5 scale)

### **Current Issues**
1. **Narrow Score Range**: All scores are clustered between 45-49
2. **Limited Differentiation**: Most stocks get similar grades
3. **Component Calculations**: Need adjustment to provide better spread

## **Recommended Improvements**

### **1. Adjust Component Calculations**
The current component calculations need modification to provide better differentiation:

- **Trend Strength**: Should vary more based on EMA alignment and MACD signals
- **Momentum**: RSI interpretation needs more aggressive thresholds
- **Support/Resistance**: Bollinger Band positioning should have more impact
- **Volume**: Currently too simplified

### **2. Modify Thresholds**
Consider adjusting the normalization thresholds:
- **Strong Buy**: ≥75 (instead of 85)
- **Buy**: ≥60 (instead of 70)
- **Neutral**: ≥40 (instead of 50)
- **Sell**: ≥20 (instead of 30)
- **Strong Sell**: <20 (instead of 30)

### **3. Enhance Component Scoring**
- **RSI**: More aggressive scoring (30-70 range should be Neutral, outside should be Buy/Sell)
- **MACD**: Stronger signals for bullish/bearish crossovers
- **EMA**: More weight on price vs EMA relationships
- **Bollinger Bands**: More emphasis on position within bands

## **Next Steps**

1. **Adjust Component Calculations**: Modify the individual component scoring to provide better differentiation
2. **Fine-tune Thresholds**: Adjust the 1-5 normalization thresholds to better reflect market conditions
3. **Test with More Data**: Run the system with more historical data to validate the scoring
4. **Compare with Market Reality**: Validate that Strong Buy/Sell signals align with actual market performance

## **Current Status**

✅ **1-5 Normalization Implemented**: The system now provides clear Strong Sell, Sell, Neutral, Buy, Strong Buy classifications

✅ **Grade Distribution Working**: Each stock gets a specific grade based on technical indicators

⚠️ **Needs Refinement**: Component calculations need adjustment to provide better score differentiation

The technical scoring system now has the proper 1-5 normalization structure, but the underlying component calculations need refinement to provide meaningful differentiation between stocks.
