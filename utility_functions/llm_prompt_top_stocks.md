# LLM Prompt: Generate Structured CSV of Top U.S.-Listed Stocks by Industry

You are a financial analyst assistant. Your task is to create a structured CSV file with up to **1,500 U.S.-listed stocks** that are **popular with retail investors** over the **past 2 years**. These stocks should span **all GICS industries**, with more entries from popular industries (e.g., Software, Semiconductors) and fewer from narrow ones (e.g., Oil Equipment).

## üéØ Selection Criteria

Only include stocks that meet **at least one** of the following:
- High **retail popularity** on platforms like Reddit, Twitter, or Robinhood
- Strong **growth potential**, stability, or consistent dividends
- High **trading volume** and **liquidity**
- Inclusion in major **ETFs** or high retail ownership

Focus on **U.S. exchanges only** (NASDAQ, NYSE, AMEX), but the company can be international.
